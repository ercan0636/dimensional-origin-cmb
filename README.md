\begin{abstract}
We present a minimal conceptual framework in which time is not assumed as a fundamental flowing parameter but is instead identified with the irreversible breaking of causal symmetry in a relational network. Within this perspective, quantum measurement corresponds to the physical orientation and locking of previously symmetric causal relations, eliminating the need for an additional collapse postulate.

Applying the same causal principle to cosmology, we reinterpret inflation not as accelerated expansion within a pre-existing spacetime, but as a dimensional phase transition of an initially low-dimensional causal structure. In this context, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is identified as the final globally coherent two-dimensional surface produced during this transition. Its intrinsic two-dimensionality, uniqueness, and large-scale anomalies arise naturally in this picture.

The framework avoids singular initial conditions, does not invoke multiple universes, and remains explicitly falsifiable. While primarily conceptual, it provides a coherent ontological basis for addressing the measurement problem, the arrow of time, and the cosmological role of the CMB.

\section{Introduction}

Two of the most persistent foundational challenges in modern physics concern the nature of quantum measurement and the origin of cosmological initial conditions. In quantum theory, the measurement problem highlights the tension between reversible microscopic dynamics and irreversible outcomes. In cosmology, attempts to describe the beginning of the universe often presuppose spacetime structures whose origin they aim to explain.

In both cases, time is typically treated as a fundamental background parameter. This assumption becomes problematic when time itself is expected to emerge or acquire physical meaning. Describing the origin of time using temporal concepts risks circularity.

This work explores an alternative approach in which time and dimensionality are not assumed a priori but emerge from a more primitive causal structure. The aim is not persuasion but coherence: to identify the minimal assumptions required for a physically meaningful origin.

\section{Time Beyond a Fundamental Parameter}

Time is often described as something that flows, yet such descriptions lack operational meaning. Any attempt to define a rate or speed of time presupposes time itself as a reference, rendering the concept tautological.

Treating time as fundamental obscures several deep issues: the emergence of irreversibility from time-symmetric laws, the distinction between past and future, and the meaningful definition of a cosmological beginning. These considerations motivate the possibility that time is emergent rather than fundamental.

\section{Symmetric Causal Networks and Pre-Temporal Structure}

We model physical reality as a relational network whose nodes represent possible events and whose links represent possible causal relations. At the most primitive level, these relations are assumed to be symmetric, admitting no intrinsic distinction between cause and effect.

In such a symmetric causal network, no temporal ordering exists, no event is irreversibly fixed, and the notion of a history is undefined. This pre-temporal regime corresponds naturally to quantum superposition and to pre-geometric descriptions of the early universe.

\section{Measurement as Causal Symmetry Breaking}

Quantum measurement is identified with the irreversible breaking of causal symmetry. When a measurement occurs, symmetric causal relations become oriented, selecting a single realized causal history and excluding alternatives.

This transition is irreversible, unique, and defines the distinction between past and future. Time is therefore not a background parameter in which measurement occurs, but the global manifestation of oriented causal relations.

\section{The Born Rule as a Structural Consistency Condition}

The Born rule is traditionally introduced as a fundamental axiom. Here it is interpreted as a structural consistency condition associated with the closure of causal relations during symmetry breaking.

Probabilities correspond to relative causal weights within the symmetric network. Squared amplitudes arise naturally from pairwise causal contributions, ensuring normalization once a single causal history is fixed.

\section{Dimensional Stability and Causal Redundancy}

Within this framework, zero-dimensional singularities are rejected as non-physical and logically inconsistent, as they are incapable of supporting relational information. Since causality constitutes the minimal structural ingredient of physical existence, it necessarily requires at least a one-dimensional linkage. A point-like origin cannot host causal relations and therefore cannot serve as a physically meaningful beginning. Consequently, the universe must emerge from a one-dimensional pre-geometric phase, where causality is purely linear and intrinsically non-local.

Dimensionality is identified with the number of independent causal directions available in the network. One-dimensional causal chains lack redundancy and are globally fragile, while two-dimensional structures provide the first stable closure of causal relations. Higher dimensions localize causality and suppress global correlations.

\section{Inflation as a Dimensional Phase Transition}

Inflation is reinterpreted as a dimensional phase transition rather than as rapid expansion within an already defined spacetime. The transition from a one-dimensional to a two-dimensional causal structure constitutes the first globally stable configuration.

This transition is finite, global, and self-terminating. Once stability is achieved, no further global dimensional inflation can occur.

\section{The Cosmic Microwave Background as a Global Two-Dimensional Surface}

Within this framework, the Cosmic Microwave Background is identified as the final globally coherent two-dimensional surface formed during the dimensional transition.

This interpretation accounts for the intrinsic two-dimensionality of the CMB, its uniqueness, and the presence of large-scale anomalies at low multipoles. The absence of unavoidable volumetric information is a fundamental feature of its origin.

\section{The Uniqueness of the CMB}

Once causal symmetry is broken and time emerges, global phase transitions are no longer possible. Temporal ordering enforces irreversibility and localizes causality, preventing the formation of additional global surfaces.

The existence of a single CMB is therefore necessary rather than contingent.

\section{Falsifiability and Observational Constraints}

The framework is falsifiable if any of the following occur: a completed measurement is causally reversible, fundamental violations of the Born rule are observed, unavoidable three-dimensional causal information is extracted from the CMB, or dimensional inflation occurs within a temporally ordered regime.

\section{Conclusion}

We have argued that time emerges from causal symmetry breaking and that cosmic inflation can be understood as a dimensional phase transition. Within this view, the CMB is the final globally coherent two-dimensional surface, explaining its structure and uniqueness without invoking singular origins or multiple universes.
